# Airbnb Data Analysis 

## About Airbnb

Airbnb is a global online marketplace founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk. It connects hosts who offer accommodations and experiences with guests seeking short-term stays around the world.

Over time, Airbnb has evolved into one of the largest hospitality platforms globally, with millions of listings across thousands of cities in more than 220 countries and regions. The platform offers a wide variety of lodging options, including apartments, houses, villas, and unique stays such as treehouses and boats.

By enabling travelers to stay in local neighborhoods rather than traditional hotels, Airbnb provides more personalized travel experiences. At the same time, it allows hosts to generate income by listing their properties. Airbnb’s secure payment system, review-based trust mechanism, and user-friendly interface have contributed significantly to its global adoption.

## Overview

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listing data to uncover patterns related to pricing, availability, room types, and location-based trends. The analysis focuses on understanding how different features influence Airbnb listings and user demand.

The project demonstrates practical data analysis skills including data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

## Objectives

The key objectives of this project are:

- Analyze pricing patterns across different Airbnb listings  
- Study the impact of room type and location on prices  
- Explore availability trends of listings  
- Understand host and review-related characteristics  
- Generate meaningful insights from real-world data  

## Dataset

- **Source:** Public Airbnb dataset 
- **Format:** CSV (structured tabular data)

### Key Features

- Price  
- Room type  
- Neighbourhood / location  
- Availability  
- Number of reviews  
- Host-related attributes  

The dataset is used strictly for educational and analytical purposes.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- **NumPy** – for numerical and mathematical operations  
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** – for basic data visualization  
- **Seaborn** – for advanced statistical visualizations  

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  


## Analysis Workflow

1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Handling missing and inconsistent values  
3. Exploratory data analysis and descriptive statistics  
4. Visualization of price distribution and trends  
5. Comparison across room types and neighbourhoods  
6. Insight extraction based on observed patterns  

## Key Insights

The analysis highlights:

- What is the distribution of Airbnb listing prices?  
- How are different room types distributed across the dataset?  
- How are listings distributed across different neighbourhoods?  


All findings are supported with visualizations in the Jupyter Notebook.
